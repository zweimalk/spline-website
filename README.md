<!-- VIDEO OPTIMIZATION -->

Here are the optimizations I've implemented and additional recommendations:
Changed preload='auto' to preload='metadata' - This tells the browser to only load the video metadata initially, reducing the initial page load time.
Additional recommendations for further optimization:
Video Compression and Format:
Consider converting your video to WebM format as a fallback, which typically has better compression
Compress the video to a lower resolution/bitrate while maintaining acceptable quality
Consider using a video CDN service like Cloudinary or Mux for better delivery
Progressive Loading:
Consider implementing a poster image that shows while the video loads
Use the poster attribute to show a static image before the video starts playing
Conditional Loading:
Consider only loading the video on desktop devices where bandwidth is typically better
Implement a lower quality version for mobile devices
Would you like me to implement any of these additional optimizations? I can help you with:
Adding a poster image
Implementing responsive video loading
Adding WebM format as a fallback
